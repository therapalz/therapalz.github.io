              <h3>
                Purpose
              </h3>
            TherapAlz aims to provide comfort that is both economically feasible
            and specialized for the unique situation for Alzheimer's caretakers and care receivers.
            Its simplistic features provides both engagement and serenity for the care receiver
            at an affordable scale.
            <br>
              <h3>
                Affordability
              </h3>
            There are other products in the making that also target patients with dementia-related disorders,
            such as Paro the therapeutic robot. However, one Paro costs five thousand dollars, money that caretakers
            will not be able to afford. TherapAlz will not cost over fifty dollars, for we believe in products that are both
            effective and cost-efficient.
            <br>
              <h3>
                Features
              </h3>
            Our first prototpye, Peachy the Fox, its primary purpose is to purr when petted. We inserted a Flex Sensor
            inside the fox such that the strip begins from the neck and ends at the middle-back.
            When this region is petted, two vibrating mini motor discs located at the base of the neck will activate,
            mimicking a purr.
            <br>
              <h3>
                Future Goals
              </h3>
            Looking into the future, we intend to implement health and safety functions in TherapAlz
            such as data analysis and message notifications. We also plan on including a wireless feature
            that will alert the caretaker of when the patient gets off of the bed.
            This product has not been commercialized.
            This fall, we are aiming to create an updated version of TherapAlz to give to Circle of Friends for a trial run.
